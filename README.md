# lucky

This is my personal project to learn Python Programming Language

This program will generate randomly power ball number. Like buying a quick pick at gas station

We can use random function from numpy popular library

random.randint(beginNumber, endNumber, sizeNumber)

Example: random.randint(1,69,5)

This will return 5 random numbers between 1 and 69

All we need to run 2 of random function, and that's it.

Why bother to write complex program? As I mentioned above, this program design to learn Python Programming Language.

Here is the list of Python Library:

1. numpy:   random number and others (3rd party library)
2. polars:   dataframe as csv (3rd party library)
3. datetime: date time format (3rd party library)
4. os:       OS file system
5. typer:    Command Line Interface (CLI) (3rd party library)
6. typing_extensions: annotation 
7. pathlib:   reading OS directory/path
8. configparser: for reading configuration file like .ini file (3rd party library)
9. loguru:   for logging   (3rd party library)
10. pytest: python testing (3rd party library)
11. Poetry: python virtual environment
